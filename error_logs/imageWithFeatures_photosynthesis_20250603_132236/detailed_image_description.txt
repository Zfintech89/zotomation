A lush, green botanical garden with a mix of tropical plants and trees in the background, subtly integrated with the primary color #0f4c81 (deep professional blue) through scattered leaves and foliage. In the foreground, a beautiful, abstract representation of a plant cell with vibrant details: chloroplasts glowing softly with accent color #f2b138 (golden yellow), while mitochondria appear as tiny spheres in secondary color #6e9cc4 (medium blue). The plant cell is placed near the center, surrounded by negative space for text overlay areas.

A few strands of DNA are illustrated nearby, twisting and turning through space, with each nucleotide base accurately represented. A delicate water droplet on a leaf's surface glimmers with slight ripples, showcasing the process of transpiration. Soft, professional lighting illuminates the scene from above, casting gentle shadows that emphasize the main subjects.

In the top-right quadrant, a stylized illustration of light energy conversion and oxygen release appears as an abstract representation, incorporating key elements from photosynthesis in secondary color #6e9cc4 (medium blue). The overall composition follows the rule of thirds, with a clear visual hierarchy guiding the viewer's attention towards the central image.

A few wispy clouds drift lazily across the top portion of the slide, subtly adding to the natural atmosphere and depth. Clean lines, minimal noise, and crisp details ensure an ultra-high-quality presentation-ready image that perfectly complements the written content on this professional PowerPoint slide.
