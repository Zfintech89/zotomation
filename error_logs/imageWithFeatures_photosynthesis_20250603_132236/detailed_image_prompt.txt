SLIDE CONTENT CONTEXT:
Topic: photosynthesis
Layout Type: imageWithFeatures
Slide Context:  This is slide 3 of 5. Focus on important considerations and implications.

COMPLETE SLIDE CONTENT:
TITLE: Understanding Photosynthesis
KEY FEATURES:
  1. Energy Production: Converts light energy into chemical energy

   - Photorealistic quality or high-end 3D rendering
   - Proper exposure and color balance
   - Sharp focus on main subjects
   - Professional studio lighting setup
   - Clean, uncluttered composition
   - Scalable elements that work at different sizes

6. CONTEXTUAL ELEMENTS TO INCLUDE (BE EXTREMELY SPECIFIC):

   - Exact positioning and interaction between elements in the composition

7. LAYOUT-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:

   - Central product or concept visualization 
   - 4 distinct areas subtly indicated for feature callouts (without numbers/text)
   - Technical demonstration or cutaway view style
   - Multiple angles or perspectives showing different aspects
   - Clean, studio-lit product photography aesthetic

8. AVOID COMPLETELY:
   - Any text, numbers, or labels within the image
   - Cluttered or busy compositions
   - Amateur photography quality
   - Inappropriate or casual imagery
   - Competing focal points
   - Dark, gloomy, or unprofessional tones
   - Copyright-protected logos or brands
   - Low resolution or pixelated elements

FINAL OUTPUT:
Generate an extremely comprehensive, highly detailed image description (300-1000 characters) that incorporates all the above requirements and directly relates to the specific slide content provided. The description should be suitable for professional AI image generation and result in a high-quality PowerPoint slide image.

Focus on creating imagery that not only looks professional but genuinely enhances and supports the specific content written on this slide. Be extremely specific about:
- Exact objects and their placement in the scene
- Detailed lighting conditions and shadows
