On a clean white background (#ffffff), a split-screen composition with 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio dominates the slide. The left side, "Challenges in Photosynthesis," features a photograph of a parched, drought-stricken crop field with scattered dead plants and wilting stalks under an overcast sky. A hint of deep professional blue (#0f4c81) frames the edge of the image.

The right side, "Real-World Applications of Photosynthesis," showcases a futuristic laboratory setting with sleek equipment and cutting-edge technology. Scientists in white coats stand around a large, cylindrical algae cultivation tank emitting a warm glow from within. Soft, natural light pours through a nearby window, casting a gentle shadow on the floor.

Key elements:

* In the foreground, a few scattered green plants on the left side have leaves withered and brown due to environmental constraints.
* On the right, an LED display above the algae tank displays a graph showing increased crop yields through genetic engineering.
* A pipette in one scientist's hand is poised over a beaker containing a glowing liquid symbolizing phycoremediation.
* The laboratory equipment has a subtle sheen, and the scientists' attire includes crisp white coats with minimal branding.

Color palette:

* Primary color #0f4c81 for main subjects, headers, and key focal points
* Secondary color #6e9cc4 for supporting elements, backgrounds, and secondary objects
* Accent color #f2b138 for highlights, call-to-action elements, and important details

Composition:

* The split-screen layout follows the rule of thirds with balanced composition.
* A subtle gradient from light to dark across the background separates the two sides effectively.

Overall, this image provides a visually engaging representation of the challenges and opportunities in photosynthesis, leveraging photorealistic quality and high-end 3D rendering for professional presentation-ready imagery.
